            <p>
                As a believer in life-long learning, personal and professional growth, I've always sought for the next right thing in life.  I became a massage therapist many years ago.  Although at first, it was just for a career, I ended up falling in love with the work and helping people feel better.  It is a very rewarding career.  After a good many years though, I started to want something more in my life.  I enrolled myself in a Yoga Teacher Training program and graduated, earning a 200 hour certificate.  In this program, I learned a lot of yoga, but what is more valuable, is what I learned about myself through the deep inner work that the curriculum encouraged us students to explore. I discovered that the many obstacles of my life are ones that I had placed in front of myself.   Through these teachings, I began to see myself and life around me in a whole new way with new approaches to life.  I realized that although I love being a massage therapist, I really wanted to tackle something challenging.  Having been creative my whole life through poetry, singing, songwriting, guitar, and henna art, I realized I needed something that would challenge me to utilize the logical aspect of my brain.  After doing some research, I came upon coding.  It is thrilling.  As I've progressed through coding bootcamp, I have delighted in being able to learn how to manipulate elements and functionality of a webpage.  While learning JavaScript, there is nothing more satisfying than putting in the hours and finally achieving working code!
